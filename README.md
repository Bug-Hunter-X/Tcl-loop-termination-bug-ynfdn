# Tcl Loop Termination Bug
This repository demonstrates a common bug in Tcl loops where the loop terminates prematurely due to an incorrect condition in the loop control statement. The bug is demonstrated in the `bug.tcl` file, and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.tcl`.  The issue involves a premature `break` statement inside the loop which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in how the loop is designed to iterate and when it terminates. It breaks the loop early, preventing the loop from fully executing its intended iterations. This leads to incomplete processing or unexpected results.
